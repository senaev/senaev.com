## Yandex (January 2016 â€” until now)

### Frontend developer in Advertising Player (Jan 2016)

When I joined [Yandex](https://yandex.com/) in 2016. Starting as a junior frontend engineer in [video advertisement](https://yandex.com/adv/products/video), I found the work twice as demanding as my previous roles. I felt I had to prove myself worthy of their trust.

I took on challenging projects like implementing [VPAID](https://iabtechlab.com/standards-old/video-player-ad-interface-definition-vpaid/) and [AdPod](https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/VAST4.0_Updated_April_2016.pdf) support, similar to YouTube's system. Over time, I mastered all the contemporary video ad standards. We created the [Content Video Player](https://yandex.ru/support2/video-player/en/) for [Kinopoisk](https://hd.kinopoisk.ru/), implemented [DRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management), and even developed a "[stitched ads](https://adcism.co.uk/what-is-ad-stitching/)" system for personalized streaming ads.

### Leading Advertising Player (Sep 2019)

After moving to Moscow in 2019, I took on team leadership. Initially managing three developers (later expanding to five), I balanced hands-on coding with leadership responsibilities while overseeing the complete renovation of both [Instream and Outstream](https://www.waytogrow.com/blog/instream-vs-outstream-video-ads-pros-cons/) advertising players.

Our team achieved significant revenue improvements through various innovations. The constant rework on formats and adding video capabilities to image banners boosted revenue for advertisers and publishers.

We implemented a comprehensive API rebuild and developed new standards for video creatives. Our performance optimization efforts were particularly successful â€“ we achieved faster first-frame loading speeds and doubled our quality metrics to match YouTube's standards.

One of major achievements was our anti-ad-blocker initiative, which recovered a big part of video ad revenue. We also successfully integrated it with various third-party platforms.

In Media Advertisement project, where we focused on attracting major international clients by developing comprehensive brand safety and anti-fraud tools. We achieved [MRC standards](https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/MRC-Viewable-Ad-Impression-Measurement-Guideline.pdf) compliance for [Yandex Direct](https://yandex.com/support/direct/technologies-and-services/iab-compliance.html) and [AdFox](https://yandex.ru/adv/news/daydzhest-dlya-pablisherov-pryamye-razmescheniya-po-mezhdunarodnym-standartam-v-adfox-i-novye-obuchayuschie-roliki), successfully integrated multiple [verification services](https://clearcode.cc/blog/ad-verification/), and maintained an incident-free record from July 2022 through 2024 through the implementation of Zero Bug Policy.

We consistently improved user experience and technical capabilities while maintaining high performance standards. Our achievements included streamlining deployment processes, enhancing cookie effectiveness, and implementing comprehensive telemetry and A/B experiments systems for quality assurance.

### Looking Back

Over my career in Yandex, I've conducted more than 150 job interviews and hired about 20 people for my teams. I've given three public speeches in English and even created a programming championship task that's been solved over 1,500 times.

## MiraLogic (Jun 2015)

At [MiraLogic](https://miralogic.ru/), I worked on router interfaces and a major platform update for [weburg.net](https://weburg.net/). Though the platform project eventually disbanded, this role gave me valuable CSS experience and my first exposure to [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/). During this time, I was also studying [React.js](https://react.dev/) with [Flux](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2014/05/06/flux.html) architecture. Attending my first tech conference, [Front Talks](https://fronttalks.ru/), proved to be a turning point, leading to interviews with Yandex.

## Tensor-SBIS (Oct 2014)

After improving my skills in OOP and [Backbone JS](https://backbonejs.org/), I landed a position at [Tensor-SBIS](https://www.tensor-sbis.ru/) by completing a test task using Backbone JS and CSS Animations. I became their first frontend engineer in the electronic tenders division, working in a small team of three. I was learning internal frameworks based on [Ext.js](https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/) while developing pet projects in my spare time.

## iTaxio (Oct 2013)

My first real break came with [iTaxio](https://vk.com/itaxio), a [Yandex Taxi](https://go.yandex/) competitor. I had to quickly switch from PHP to JavaScript, learning everything through trial and error. The salary was decent at 25-35 thousand rubles, and I gained valuable experience with [KnockoutJS](https://knockoutjs.com/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), and [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) (Phonegap).
